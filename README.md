# ST0296 - Data Structures & Algorithms using C++

This project is a C++ console application developed by shernaliu for ST0296 - Data Structures & Algorithms using C++ back in 2016 in SP - DIT.

The name of this application is called Starboundex.

It is similar to a Pokedex, but the dataset used are the animals and monsters from the game Starbound.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of:
- Encapsulation using C++ classes
- Inheritance
- Pointers
- STL sequence container (vector)
- Use of iterators to process elements in the container
- File Input/Output

Functionalities:

- Read & initialize all animals and monsters from a text file
- Main menu to Search, Add, Edit, Delete all animals and monsters

This project uses data from the Starbound game [Starbound monsters](https://starbounder.org/Monster).
